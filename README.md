# docker Compose Grafana and Influxdb

Multi-container Docker app built from the following services:

* [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) - time series database
* [Chronograf](https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf) - admin UI for InfluxDB
* [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) - visualization UI for InfluxDB

Useful for quickly setting up a monitoring stack for performance testing. Combine with [serverless-artillery](https://github.com/Nordstrom/serverless-artillery) and [artillery-plugin-influxdb](https://github.com/Nordstrom/artillery-plugin-influxdb) to create a performance testing environment in minutes.

## Quick Start

To start the app:

1. Clone this repo on the docker host.
1. Optionally, change default credentials or Grafana provisioning.
1. Run the following command from the root of the cloned repo:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the app:

1. Run the following command from the root of the cloned repo:
```
docker-compose down
```

## Run Sripts

```
docker-compose run -v $PWD/scripts:/scripts k6 run --out influxdb=http://influxdb:8086/db0 -w /scripts/samples_script_test.js

```

```
docker-compose run -v $PWD/scripts:/scripts k6 run --out influxdb=http://influxdb:8086/db0 -w /scripts/samples_test.js

```

## Ports

The services in the app run on the following ports:

| Host Port | Service |
| - | - |
| 3000 | Grafana |
| 8086 | InfluxDB |
| 127.0.0.1:8888 | Chronograf |

Note that Chronograf does not support username/password authentication. Anyone who can connect to the service has full admin access. Consequently, the service is not publically exposed and can only be access via the loopback interface on the same machine that runs docker.

## Volumes

The app creates the following named volumes (one for each service) so data is not lost when the app is stopped:

* influxdb-storage
* chronograf-storage
* grafana-storage

## Users

The app creates two admin users - one for InfluxDB and one for Grafana. By default, the username and password of both accounts is `admin`. To override the default credentials, set the following environment variables before starting the app:

* `INFLUXDB_USERNAME`
* `INFLUXDB_PASSWORD`
* `GRAFANA_USERNAME`
* `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`

## Database

The app creates a default InfluxDB database called `db0`.

## Data Sources

The app creates a Grafana data source called `InfluxDB` that's connected to the default IndfluxDB database (e.g. `db0`).

To provision additional data sources, see the Grafana [documentation](http://docs.grafana.org/administration/provisioning/#datasources) and add a config file to `./grafana-provisioning/datasources/` before starting the app.

## Dashboards

By default, the app does not create any Grafana dashboards. An example dashboard that's configured to work with [artillery-plugin-influxdb](https://github.com/Nordstrom/artillery-plugin-influxdb) is located at `./grafana-provisioning/dashboards/artillery.json.example`. To use this dashboard, rename it to `artillery.json`.

To provision additional dashboards, see the Grafana [documentation](http://docs.grafana.org/administration/provisioning/#dashboards) and add a config file to `./grafana-provisioning/dashboards/` before starting the app.

In this project, i used this official K6 dashboard [k6 Load Testing Results](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/2587); for used then is so import id `2587` in running grafana `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/new?orgId=1`
